Language lives when you speak it. Let it be heard. The worst thing that could have happen to words it's that they go unsaid.
So let them sing in your ears, and dance in your mouth and ache in your gut. Let them make everything tighten and shine.

Once there was religion so i hear. There was a God, it made it all less worthless. And they gave us the because we have all been searching for. Unarguable truth. A reason to be kind and just. A reason to be just and send the sinner to sinnerland. And made us all feel better in the knowledge that the righteous would be right and just forever. Once, there was religion and it ruled. And we all had it bad. We fooled ourselves to sleep that night. We said this was this, and that was that. And if our morals ever shook we looked no further than the book, but gradually we felt its pressure: it became the great oppresor. 

And without God, the wars seemed crueler. Life seemed stranger, life seemed foolish. Death seemed bleaker now than ever. What was mankind for? What terror flooded us to understand there was no point? No grander plan? There was just living out each day? Work, eat, sleep, fuck, pass away? Without the fear of retribution? We found guilt-free pleasure, but we lost the sense of union that had kept us all together. And we needed something new, to fill the emptiness that grew. And what's better to believe in, than all you can eat: freedom. The dream of being who you are by virtue of the things you buy. The joy, of getting rich enough, to live outside the common life. And now, there is no purpose that exists beyond our needs. Now, there is the worship of convenience and speed.
